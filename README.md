 Interactive form with javascript

<b>Real-time error message</b> - When the user typing there will show any error message in real-time if something is not fit the input requires. I am using 'keyup' event on inputs and I call 'validate' function on it with 'display' function to display any error messages.

<b>Conditional error message</b> - This future shows when typing the credit card number that how much to be left until 13 digits what is the minimum length for credit cards. For example: Enter minimum 13 more numbers, Enter minimum 12 more numbers, Enter minimum 11 more numbers... so on.
I am using this future in ccNum 'keyup' event to get real time typed input.
